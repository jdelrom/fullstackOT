openMesa is a website designed using Ruby on Rails with React/Redux.  Inspired by OpenTable, a booking website for restaurants.  Designed in less than 10 days, more features to come from this clone.

## Technologies:
openMesa was designed with production startup speed in mind.   Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL were used for backend development and database management.  The flexibility and innovative technology allowed for a quick construction and upstart for the web application.  

React/Redux was chosen for frontend development for it's versatility and adaptability.  It's ability to communicate effectively with the backend database allowed for easy manipulation of data.

## Project Design:
openMesa was designed with OpenTable's site in mind.  The idea was to replicate an almost identical web application.  Given the timeframe, more will be added to create a more pixel perfect design, but in the short amount of time, the simplicity of OpenTable's interface was applied.  Along with aesthetics, it's user friendly functionality was also implemented with the features created in the time frame.
